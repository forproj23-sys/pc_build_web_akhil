PC BUILDING WEBSITE – PROJECT OVERVIEW
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
________________________________________
Project Title: PC Build Configuration Website
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
________________________________________
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
________________________________________
Building a custom PC is complex due to compatibility issues between hardware components.
Users often lack technical knowledge and must rely on multiple websites for specifications and prices.
There is no proper coordination between users, PC assemblers, and component suppliers in traditional systems.
________________________________________
3. PROPOSED SOLUTION
________________________________________
A centralized web application that allows users to build custom PC configurations with compatibility validation.
The system connects users, PC assemblers, and suppliers through role-based access.
Admins manage the platform, ensuring accurate component data and smooth workflow.
